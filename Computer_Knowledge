In compueters, there is a wall/gate called the ip address
The ip address is 4 digits long and is used to access other places on the internet
All devices using the same wifi router all have the same ip address
the ip address is shown whenever you try to get to another website, so that you see both ip's
(VPN's change your ip address)
Your ip addreess shows the general area of where you live
ip banning is when they ban you and if you make a different accoutn for that site, you wont be accepted because your ip is the same
